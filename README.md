## Libraries Used and What They Do
pandas

#### What it does: Helps us work with data tables.
Why we used it: It loads the paygap.csv file and lets us explore, filter, and organize the data.
matplotlib

#### What it does: Helps us make graphs and charts.
Why we used it: It allows us to visualize the gender wage gap over time by plotting the data for different countries.


#### What is doe: A toolkit for working with text data.
Why we might use it: If the dataset had any text columns, like comments or descriptions, NLTK would help clean the text.
